##### (vanilla js router option 4 layout)

**Today's Progress**: I create vanillajs router and fix some bugs on progress also color lights and some router things.

**Thoughts** i have to take many desicions
during the progress, i was fixing the code
because vanilla and this code start growing
so i wanna kept it simple and easy to manage. 
Also curious about in js call an html
you should use fecth or xmtp or ajax
i thought it would be more simple.

### Day 3: June 20, 2022
##### (project section)

**Today's Progress**: Learning about grid and flex-box autosizing on decreasing window and the differences. Also, I watched interviews with CSS and react for learning how are challenges on the front end ðŸŒ‚

**Thoughts** 
flex and grid are for templates and layout
i think they have a lot function that you have to memorize, so i need something to memorize the principal tools of both and learn each case and where to use it.
for example. flex-shrink where to use it what parameters received.



**css box model**
margin border padding content
**css grid vs flex**
grid is better as 2d and have more control, flex one row or column and not very good to control
**css flex properties**
flex gap
flex grown
**React replicate wordle game**
react use effect, use state
handle event every 5
**Salaries**
