##### (vanilla js router option 4 layout)

**Today's Progress**: I create vanillajs router and fix some bugs on progress also color lights and some router things.

**Thoughts** i have to take many desicions
during the progress, i was fixing the code
because vanilla and this code start growing
so i wanna kept it simple and easy to manage. 
Also curious about in js call an html
you should use fecth or xmtp or ajax
i thought it would be more simple.
