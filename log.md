Also curious about in js call an html

### Day 3: June 20, 2022
##### (project section)

**Today's Progress**: Learning about grid and flex-box autosizing on decreasing window and the differences. Also, I watched interviews with CSS and react for learning how are challenges on the front end ðŸŒ‚

**Thoughts** 
flex and grid are for templates and layout
i think they have a lot function that you have to memorize, so i need something to memorize the principal tools of both and learn each case and where to use it.
for example. flex-shrink where to use it what parameters received.



**css box model**
margin border padding content
**css grid vs flex**
grid is better as 2d and have more control, flex one row or column and not very good to control
**css flex properties**
flex gap
flex grown
**React replicate wordle game**
react use effect, use state
handle event every 5

**Today's Progress** Good github pages
**Thoughts** 
/*"homepage": "https://kalugy.gitgub.io/kalugy-projects/",*/

choose netlify 
Also I lose two interviews
One challenge in node i thought the server when i was making the code stop running and the result was the same so funny but next time i will sure to make pass the exam no matter the server

### Day 17: June 28, 2022
##### (Finish All certifications)
**Today's Progress** Change all routing main system support f5
**Thoughts** 
A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages. The goal is faster transitions that make the website feel more like a native app.

In a SPA, a page refresh never occurs; instead, all necessary HTML, JavaScript, and CSS code is either retrieved by the browser with a single page load,[1] or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions.

so before i think all html and css and js was load to page
that happen and the page were really slow
So spa apllication are for load little code depending of the user interaction

somehow with framworks now HTML is short part of code 

future task to end post
- Create routing system for Blog with the new system
- Create Blog1
- Create Blog2
- Create Blog3
- Also i want that blogs state at database so info would on database at some point not for now 
- Create Log In but not working for now
